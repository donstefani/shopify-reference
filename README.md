# Shopify Product Object Reference

This repository contains **quick reference documentation** for the Shopify **Product object** across different contexts:

- **Admin REST API** â€” full JSON product object with variants, options, and images  
- **Admin GraphQL API** â€” GraphQL query/response format with product, variants, options, and images  
- **Liquid (Theme Layer)** â€” product object as available in themes (`product`, `variants`, `images`, `options`, `collections`)  

The goal of this project is to provide developers with a **clear and complete example** of the Product object structure, including variants, images, options, and related properties.  
These references are meant to be a practical aid for developers working with Shopify APIs or theme development.
